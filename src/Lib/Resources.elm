{-| allTexture

A list of all the textures.

Add your textures here. Don't worry if your list is too long. You can split those resources according to their usage.

Examples:

[
( "ball", getResourcePath "img/ball.png" ),
( "car", getResourcePath "img/car.jpg" )
]

allTexture : List ( String, String )
allTexture =
    []
